##################
# Message Syntax #
##################
Command messages are completely capitalized and must only contain ASCII
alphabetic characters.  Command parameters are separated with a single space
characters. The final parameter may be preceded by an optional colon ":"
character. All parameters (excluding the last, colon prefixed parameter) must
not contain any space characters. The final parameter, if preceded by the
colon, can contain all ASCII characters, except a newline character.  Commands
are terminated with a newline character.  The following is an example of a
valid command message: 

HELLO param#1 param#2 param#3 :parameter #4\n

The server may or may not send a response back to the client when it receives a
command message.

# Joining a Server #
####################
1. TCP connection is established between the client and server 
2. Before issuing any other commands to the server (with the exception of the
QUIT command), the client must send a USER message to the server, requesting the
use of the username specified by the parameter.
3. The server will respond with one of the following messages:
    a. ERROR_NEED_MORE_PARAMS - when the username parameter is missing or is
    empty
    b. ERROR_ALREADY_REGISTERED - when the username is already in use
    c. SUCCESS_WELCOME_TO_SERVER - when the username is not in use, and is
    successfully reserved for the client

Only when the SUCCESS_WELCOME_TO_SERVER message is passed to the client may it
send other commands to the server
